George Brown College is a school I am currently studying in, and it is located on the Casa Loma campus. 
This college offers students opportunities for internships and real-world experiences.

George Brown College offers a lot of fun events like Escape room, watching movies in cinema, Paint night, and Cruise night!
There are so much more events to talk about but I believe these events are what I find really fun.

George Brown College has 3 campuses in Toronto City, St James, Waterfront, and in Casa Loma.
I have been to 3 different campus and I find Casa Loma more better in terms of experiences and how long i've been here.

George Brown Casa Loma has a lot of facilities to offer. They have a library where we have to book certain rooms in a kiosk or through
a website to study and discuss with friends or students.
