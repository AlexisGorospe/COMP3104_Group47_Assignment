George Brown College is a school I am currently studying in, and it is located on the Casa Loma campus. 
This college offers students opportunities for internships and real-world experiences.

George Brown College offers a lot of fun events like Escape room, watching movies in cinema, Paint night, and Cruise night!
There are so much more events to talk about but I believe these events are what I find really fun.
