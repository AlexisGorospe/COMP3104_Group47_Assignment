Learning DevOps is essential in modern software development cycles (SDLC) as it bridges the gap between development and operations teams, ensuring faster, more reliable releases. By learning DevOps, developers and operations teams can collaborate more effectively, reducing the chances of failure in production environments.
DevOps practices, such as automation and monitoring, significantly improve the efficiency and quality of the SDLC, leading to faster and more reliable software releases.
The SDLC with DevOps involves continuous feedback and monitoring to ensure software quality.
