DevOps integrates development, IT operations, and security through automation, optimized workflows, and cross-functional collaboration. 
This methodology enhances software delivery speed and reliability, promoting continuous improvement and innovation. 
By utilizing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), DevOps ensures real-time feedback and rapid iteration in response to evolving market needs. 
DevSecOps emphasizes embedding security from the initial stages of development, reducing vulnerabilities and improving overall system integrity. 
Notably, organizations employing DevOps deploy updates significantly faster, with top-performing teams delivering changes 46 times faster than those using conventional methods.
