"DevOps integrates development and IT, automating processes to enable faster, reliable software delivery and collaboration. It reduces deployment failures by up to 50% and increases deployment frequency, allowing some companies to release updates hundreds of times a day. DevOps also fosters innovation by freeing up teams from manual tasks, allowing more time for creative problem-solving and continuous improvement."
