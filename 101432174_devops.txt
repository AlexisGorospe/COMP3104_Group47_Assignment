DevOps unites development, IT operations, and security through automated, optimized workflows and strong cross-functional teamwork. 
This approach drives faster, more reliable software delivery while fostering continuous improvement, innovation, and resilience. 
DevOps leverages continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to provide real-time feedback, enabling rapid adaptation to changing market conditions. 
With DevSecOps, security is integrated early in the development process, mitigating risks and ensuring robust system integrity. 
Top-performing organizations that implement DevOps see up to 46 times faster deployment rates, achieving both agility and stability.
