DevOps integrates development, IT operations, and security through automation and streamlined workflows. 
This approach not only ensures faster, more reliable software delivery but also fosters seamless collaboration across teams. 
By leveraging continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, DevOps enables rapid feedback loops and swift adaptation to changes in the market. 
Security practices, such as those in DevSecOps, are embedded throughout the development lifecycle, ensuring protection from the outset. 
A key advantage is the ability to reduce lead time for changes, with top-performing organizations deploying updates up to 46 times faster than traditional methods.
