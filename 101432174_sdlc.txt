The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for software development, guiding teams through key stages such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. 
This structured approach ensures that software is delivered on schedule, within budget, and meets rigorous quality standards. 
A key benefit of adopting SDLC is the reduction in software project failure rates by up to 40%, as well as the improved efficiency in project execution. 
Additionally, Agile frameworks, which function within the SDLC, have proven to boost customer satisfaction by encouraging continuous feedback and iterative product enhancements.
