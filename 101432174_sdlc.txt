The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured methodology for software development, guiding teams through distinct stages like planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. 
This framework ensures that projects are delivered on time, within budget, and to a high standard of quality. 
One notable advantage is that using a formal SDLC process can lower the risk of software project failure by up to 40%. 
Frameworks like Agile, operating within the SDLC, have also improved customer satisfaction by incorporating continuous feedback and iterative development.
