"SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a structured process for developing software through defined stages efficiently, from planning and design to testing and deployment. It ensures that software is delivered on time and within budget while meeting quality standards. An interesting fact is that using a formal SDLC process can reduce software project failure rates by up to 40%, ensuring smoother development and more successful project outcomes."
