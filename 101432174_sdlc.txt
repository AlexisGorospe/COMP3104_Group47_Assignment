The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a comprehensive framework that guides software development teams through critical stages such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. 
This structured methodology ensures timely delivery, budget adherence, and compliance with stringent quality standards. 
Adopting SDLC practices has been shown to reduce project failure rates by as much as 40%, while also improving project management efficiency. 
Moreover, Agile frameworks integrated within the SDLC further enhance customer satisfaction through continuous feedback and iterative improvements, allowing for flexible adjustments throughout the project.
