George Brown College is a college.
I go there and I think it is a pretty cool place to 
learn stuff related to programming.

In my campus, there are things there like resurants and a cafeteria.
we also have this empty space in the E building for some reason.
I'm guessing that it's used for airflow but I think it could be 
decorated as long as it doesn't disrupt anybody.

I heard they are going to renovate the place.
